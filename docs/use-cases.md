# Use Cases for Bugged API Trainer

## Use Case 1: User Login
**Description:**  
A beginner QA engineer can test the login functionality by sending various requests to the login endpoint. They can practice identifying issues such as incorrect status codes (e.g., 200 instead of 401 for unauthorized access) and missing validation messages.

**Steps:**
1. Open the API Tester interface.
2. Select the login endpoint.
3. Input various credentials (valid, invalid, empty).
4. Send the request and observe the response.
5. Identify any discrepancies in the response.

## Use Case 2: User Registration
**Description:**  
Users can test the registration endpoint to ensure that it handles different scenarios, such as duplicate usernames or missing required fields.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the registration endpoint in the API Tester.
2. Input data with missing fields or duplicate usernames.
3. Send the request and analyze the response for appropriate error messages and status codes.

## Use Case 3: Fetching User Data
**Description:**  
QA engineers can practice fetching user data and validating the structure of the response, ensuring that it matches the expected format.

**Steps:**
1. Access the users endpoint.
2. Send a request to fetch user data.
3. Review the response for completeness and correctness.
4. Identify any missing fields or incorrect data types.

## Use Case 4: Placing an Order
**Description:**  
This use case allows users to test the order placement functionality, focusing on validating the response for successful and failed orders.

**Steps:**
1. Go to the orders endpoint in the API Tester.
2. Input valid and invalid order data.
3. Send the request and check the response for correct status codes and messages.
4. Note any inconsistencies in the order processing logic.

## Use Case 5: Error Handling
**Description:**  
Users can intentionally trigger errors to test the application's error handling capabilities and ensure that appropriate messages are returned.

**Steps:**
1. Use the API Tester to send requests with invalid parameters or to non-existent endpoints.
2. Observe the error responses and verify that they provide useful information for debugging.

## Conclusion
These use cases provide a structured approach for beginner QA engineers to practice API testing using the Bugged API Trainer. Each scenario focuses on identifying common issues that may arise in real-world applications, enhancing their testing skills and understanding of API behavior.
