# Tasks for Bugged API Trainer Development

## Task List

### Backend Development
1. **Set Up Express Server**
   - Create `app.js` to initialize the Express application.
   - Configure middleware for parsing JSON and handling errors.

2. **Create Routes**
   - Implement routes in `routes/index.js` to set up main application routes.
   - Develop specific routes for:
     - User login (`routes/login.js`)
     - User management (`routes/users.js`)
     - Order management (`routes/orders.js`)

3. **Implement Controllers**
   - Create controllers for handling business logic:
     - `LoginController` for login-related logic.
     - `UsersController` for user-related operations.
     - `OrdersController` for order-related operations.

4. **Develop Services**
   - Implement services to encapsulate business logic:
     - `LoginService` for login processing.
     - `UsersService` for user data handling.
     - `OrdersService` for order processing.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Create an error handler in `utils/errorHandler.js` to manage application errors gracefully.

### Frontend Development
1. **Set Up React Application**
   - Initialize the React application structure.
   - Create main components:
     - `RequestForm` for sending API requests.
     - `ResponseViewer` for displaying API responses.
     - `Header` for the application header.

2. **Develop Pages**
   - Create the main page (`Home.jsx`) and API testing page (`ApiTester.jsx`).

3. **Connect Frontend to Backend**
   - Implement API calls from the frontend to the backend using the `RequestForm` component.

4. **User Interface Enhancements**
   - Ensure the UI is user-friendly and focused on API testing.

### Documentation
1. **Document Architecture**
   - Write detailed architecture documentation in `architecture.md`.

2. **Use Cases**
   - Create use case scenarios in `use-cases.md` to guide users on how to utilize the application.

3. **Task Tracking**
   - Maintain this `tasks.md` file to track ongoing and completed tasks throughout the development process.

### Future Enhancements
- Plan for XML handling capabilities.
- Implement automated tests for the trainer.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
- Containerize the application using Docker for local development.

## Notes
- Follow the MVP philosophy to ensure each feature is functional before moving on to the next.
- Prioritize code quality, modularity, and maintainability throughout the development process.
