# 🐞 Bugged API Trainer

An API testing trainer for beginner QA engineers, designed to simulate real-world buggy APIs for hands-on practice.

## Project structure:
- `/mock-api/` — mock API server with intentionally broken endpoints for testing practice
- `/frontend/` — UI interface for interacting with the mock API (Postman-like experience)
- `/docs/` — project documentation, architecture, API tasks and use cases

## Getting Started: Mock API

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd mock-api
npm install
